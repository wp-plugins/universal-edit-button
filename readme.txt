== Description ==

The <a href="http://universaleditbutton.org/">Universal Edit Button</a> is an icon in the URL bar that indicates a web page is editable; and clicking it takes the user directly to the edit view.  This plugin adds a tag in the head of each post and page, that will activate the UEB if the user has it installed and has edit rights for that page.

== Usage ==

No settings. Just install and activate.  Users who are logged to your site and have edit privileges will see the Universal Edit Button in their browser toolbar.  (You must also have the Universal Edit Button plugin installed in your browser.)
